Welcome, Iâ€™m Nemainn, a beginner game developer. Have some experience with programming (Python and Java at intermediate level, C++ basics), Blender, Krita, Gimp and Unity. I do everything on my own, and I finally decided to share some of my work in the future. If you have any suggestions, be free to share it with me. Iâ€™m interested in physics and astronomy, my hobbies are also programming and game developing. Iâ€™m currently learning Blender, Krita, C++ and practice my programming skills. 
Iâ€™m not currently looking for collaboration but if you have some interesting ideas and looking for someone to discuss and maybe make them real, text to me.
